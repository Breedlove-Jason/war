# Card Game Project

This project is a simple implementation of a card game using Python. The game is a simulation of a war card game between two players.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into four main Python files:

1. `card.py`: This file defines the `Card` class, which represents a single card with a rank, suit, and value. It also defines the suits and ranks used in a deck of cards.

2. `deck.py`: This file defines the `Deck` class, which represents a deck of cards. It includes methods for shuffling the deck and dealing a card.

3. `player.py`: This file defines the `Player` class, which represents a player in the card game. It includes methods for removing a card from the player's hand and adding one or more cards to the player's hand.

4. `main.py`: This file contains the main game logic for the card game.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```
